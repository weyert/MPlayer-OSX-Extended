Build Instructions
------------------

The project can be built using either XCode 3 or 4.
Make sure you've got the dependencies below and then you should be able to compile MPE directly with XCode.

### Dependencies

#### Sparkle

MPE requires my [Sparkle Fork](https://github.com/sttz/Sparkle).
It adds updating separate bundles without a restart, used in MPE for updating its binary bundles with Sparkle.

#### Fontconfig & Freetype

It's best to use the same Fontconfig and Freetype versions as used in the binary bundle. The default setup links to the libraries inside the `mpextended.mpBinaries` bundle in the binaries folder. The easiest way to get that is download the latest (test) version of MPE and extracting the binary bundle form "`MPlayer OSX Extened.app/Contents/Resources/Binaries`".

**Note**: I've reorganized the bundle after the FFMpeg-MT merge and haven't released a test version with it yet. For now it's probably best to link to the system Fontconfig and Freetype libraries.
